<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
<h3>MY BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>My name is Rachael Gatwiri, I just finished my Highschool; <em>2020-2021</em>. Since I was a litle child it has been my dream to invent something new.I have always wished to invent different things which will benefit and be a source of solutions to challenges being faced in our communities.<span class="important"> Not only just solving problems but also solving problems technically</span>.Therefore, when I completed my highschool education, I had to think of a course which will help me fulfill my dream. I asked an advice from my brother who is my mentor and what he told me, it's that software development suits me and Moringa School is the best school;so far, in my country which can help me.He advised me to join the school and so far I can testify it is the best school. I have learnt alot in a short period of time!!!
